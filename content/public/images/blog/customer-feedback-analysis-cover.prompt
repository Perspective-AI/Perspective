# Cover Image Suggestions for "Real-Time Customer Feedback Analysis"

1. A modern dashboard interface showing real-time analytics with colorful graphs and charts, with a focus on customer feedback metrics. The image should convey immediacy and data-driven decision making.

2. A split-screen concept showing the contrast between traditional feedback (paper surveys, slow process) and modern real-time feedback (digital interface, instant updates). Use a clean, minimalist design with a clear visual hierarchy.

3. An abstract visualization of data streams and feedback loops, with bright, flowing lines representing real-time customer interactions. The design should feel dynamic and forward-moving, suggesting immediate action and response.
