# Cover Image Suggestions for "Why Your VOC Program Isn't Telling You the Full Story"

1. A visual metaphor showing a customer's voice being filtered through multiple layers (like a funnel or sieve), with some insights getting lost at each layer. The design should use a clean, modern style with subtle gradients.

2. A split-screen showing the difference between traditional VOC (static surveys, limited responses) and modern VOC (dynamic conversations, rich insights). Use contrasting colors and clear visual hierarchy to show the evolution.

3. An abstract representation of customer feedback as puzzle pieces, with some pieces missing or incomplete. The design should use warm, inviting colors and suggest the idea of "completing the picture" of customer understanding.
