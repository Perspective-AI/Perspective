# The Rise of AI Translators: Why 57% of Executives Never Touch AI Directly

Who’s really making the decisions in your organization—the AI, or the people interpreting it for you?

In our newest report, [Executive AI Adoption: Insights on Decision-Making Practices From The C-Suite](https://getperspective.ai/page/686d6cb7205fc07767397638), we recently uncovered a surprising trend: 57% of C-suite executives don’t interact directly with AI tools. Instead, they rely on staff—what we call “AI translators”—to interpret, filter, and present AI-generated insights before they ever reach the top.

At first glance, this seems efficient. After all, executives are busy, and AI tools can be complex. But here’s the catch: every layer of translation adds a new filter, a new bias, and a new opportunity for critical details to get lost or misrepresented. The “objectivity” of AI is only as strong as the human lens it passes through.

This post explores the rise of AI translators, the risks and benefits of this model, and how executives can ensure they’re getting the real story from their AI tools.

## What Is an AI Translator?

An AI translator is a staff member—often in roles like business intelligence, operations, or marketing—who interacts directly with AI tools, interprets the outputs, and presents the findings to senior leadership. These individuals act as intermediaries, bridging the gap between complex AI systems and the decision-makers who rely on their insights.

### Why is this role emerging?

- **Time Efficiency**: Executives delegate the technical work of interacting with AI tools to save time.  
- **Specialized Skills**: AI tools often require technical expertise, such as prompt engineering or data validation, which not all executives possess.  
- **Simplified Communication**: Translators distill complex AI outputs into actionable insights, making it easier for leaders to focus on strategy.

## The Benefits of AI Translators

When managed effectively, AI translators can add significant value to an organization:

- **Time Savings**: Executives can focus on high-level strategy while translators handle the technical heavy lifting.  
- **Specialized Expertise**: Translators develop deep familiarity with AI tools, optimizing prompts and identifying potential errors.  
- **Contextualization**: Translators can tailor AI outputs to align with organizational goals and priorities.

## The Risks of Relying on AI Translators

However, this model isn’t without its challenges. Relying too heavily on AI translators can introduce risks that undermine the value of AI insights:

- **Loss of Nuance**: Translators may unintentionally filter out critical details or context that could influence decisions.  
- **Bias Introduction**: Human interpretation can introduce biases, distorting the objectivity of AI outputs.  
- **Trust Gaps**: Executives who don’t engage directly with AI may struggle to fully trust the insights they receive.  
- **Over-Reliance**: Organizations risk becoming dependent on a small group of translators, creating bottlenecks or vulnerabilities if those individuals leave.

## What Executives Are Saying

Here’s how some of the executives we interviewed described the role of AI translators in their organizations:

> "The staff will usually summarize their analysis and conclusions, but the analysis is a filtered view of what the outputs provided to them. Depending on our comfort level with the perceived filter or analysis, we will ask them to go back in certain instances to change their assumptions."  
> — Gregory Baden, General Counsel, NetBrain Technologies

> "Our Director of Rev Ops works closely with [AI tools] on improving and revising prompts to meet our specific needs. We often tailor things to better understand our ICP."  
> — Jeff Soriano, VP of Marketing, Brightflag

These quotes highlight both the value and the risks of relying on AI translators. While they can streamline workflows and improve efficiency, they also create a layer of interpretation that executives must carefully manage.

## How to Manage AI Translators Effectively

To maximize the benefits of AI translators while minimizing risks, executives should implement the following best practices:

- **Maintain Transparency**: Always request access to raw AI outputs alongside summaries.  
- **Invest in Training**: Provide AI translators with formal training in prompt engineering, bias detection, and output validation.  
- **Establish Clear Guidelines**: Define when translators should escalate issues to executives.  
- **Create Feedback Loops**: Regularly review translator performance and provide feedback.  
- **Audit the Process**: Periodically spot-check AI outputs and translator summaries to ensure alignment.

## When Should Executives Engage Directly with AI?

While AI translators can handle much of the technical work, there are situations where direct executive engagement is essential:

- **High-Stakes Decisions**: For critical decisions, executives should review raw AI outputs.  
- **Complex Contexts**: Direct engagement helps bridge gaps between AI analysis and real-world implications.  
- **Building Trust**: Regular interaction with AI tools helps executives develop confidence in their capabilities and limitations.

## The Future of AI Translation in Leadership

As AI adoption continues to grow, the role of AI translators will become increasingly important. However, organizations must strike a balance between delegation and direct engagement. The most successful leaders will be those who know when to rely on translators and when to step in themselves.

**Key Takeaways for Executives:**

- AI translators are valuable, but they’re not a substitute for executive oversight.  
- Transparency, training, and clear guidelines are essential for managing AI translation effectively.  
- Direct engagement with AI tools is critical for high-stakes or complex decisions.

By understanding the role of AI translators and implementing best practices, executives can ensure they’re getting the full value of AI insights—without losing control of the decision-making process.
