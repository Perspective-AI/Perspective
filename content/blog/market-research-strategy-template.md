# How to Build a Market Research Strategy Template That Actually Guides Action

Market research often ends up as a checkbox itemâ€”a static report filed away, rarely referenced after presentation. But a strong market research strategy template doesn't just document findings. It drives decisions.

This guide walks you through building a research strategy template that isn't just informative, but actually usefulâ€”guiding product strategy, market entry, messaging, and customer understanding in a repeatable, scalable way.

## Why a Strategy Template Matters More Than a Report

A report captures answers. A strategy template defines the questions you need to ask, the structure of your exploration, and the way you'll apply what you learn.

Instead of asking "What did we find out?", a well-designed market research strategy template prompts:

- What are we trying to learn and why?
- Who do we need to hear from?
- How will insights affect roadmap, GTM, or positioning?
- What gaps remain?

## What to Include in Your Market Research Strategy Template

You don't need 30 pages to get actionable. Here are the core components your template should include:

### 1. **Research Objective**
One clear paragraph. What's the strategic decision you're trying to inform? Be specific (e.g., "Determine whether to reposition our mid-market plan to compete with new entrants").

### 2. **Key Research Questions**
Write 3-5 foundational questions. These should be decision-oriented, like:
- "What factors drive purchase decisions in this category?"
- "What alternatives do target customers consider?"
- "What triggers customer dissatisfaction or switching?"

### 3. **Audience Profile**
Define who you need to hear from. Segment by:
- Role / job function
- Company size / industry
- Stage in customer lifecycle (prospect, current, churned)

### 4. **Research Method**
Be deliberate: Will this be interviews, surveys, or both? Qualitative research (e.g., AI-guided interviews) is essential for uncovering motivations, language, and nuance.

### 5. **Application Plan**
This is where most templates fall short. Define how findings will be used:
- What team(s) will review results?
- What decisions will this influence (roadmap, messaging, pricing)?
- How will insights be integrated into planning?

### 6. **Timeline and Milestones**
Outline:
- Launch date
- Data collection window
- Debrief and synthesis dates
- Stakeholder presentations

This helps you set expectations and maintain momentum.

### 7. **Open Questions and Assumptions**
End your template with a reality check: What are you assuming to be true? What gaps do you expect this research to clarify? Documenting these sharpens focus and improves interpretation.
