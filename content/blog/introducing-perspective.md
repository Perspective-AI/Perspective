Hey everyone,

I'd like to share something exciting with you. While we're still technically pre-launch, we're officially opening Perspective for everyone to try, and I couldn't be more thrilled about the problem we're tackling and the potential impact we can make together.

## The Problem We're Solving

Let's face it: feedback is essential for doing our best work. Whether you're developing a product, refining a service, or simply trying to improve your performance, quality feedback is the cornerstone of progress. But here's the catch – getting meaningful feedback is often a slow, cumbersome, and frankly, uninspiring process.
That's where Perspective comes in. We're on a mission to make feedback easy, fast, and – believe it or not – enjoyable.

## Why We're Passionate About This

Throughout my career, I've seen firsthand how powerful good feedback can be. It can transform ideas, elevate products, and empower individuals to reach new heights. But I've also experienced the frustration of trying to gather insightful feedback using outdated tools and methods.

We believe that in a world where AI is transforming everything, we have a unique opportunity to revolutionize how we collect, analyze, and act on feedback. We're not just building another survey tool – we're creating a platform that fosters meaningful conversations and drives better decisions.

## What We're Building

At Perspective, we're harnessing the power of AI to create a feedback experience that's as simple as sending an email, but infinitely more insightful. We're combining intuitive user interfaces with advanced AI to make every feedback interaction count.

Our goal is to make meaningful conversations universally accessible. We want to enable anyone – from startup founders to corporate leaders, from product designers to HR professionals – to have in-depth, insightful conversations that can drive better decisions and foster deeper connections.

## Join Us on This Journey

We're just getting started, and we're building something awesome. But we can't do it alone. We need your support, your insights, and your passion to help shape the future of feedback.

Whether you're frustrated with current feedback methods, excited about the potential of AI, or simply curious about what we're building, we'd love to have you on board. Sign up for our beta, share your thoughts, or just follow our journey – every bit of support counts.

Together, we can transform feedback from a chore into a powerful tool for growth and innovation.
Are you ready to join us in revolutionizing feedback? Let's make every voice count!

Warm regards,
Guy Nirpaz Founder, Perspective
