I think we all agree: the best way to understand someone is to have a real conversation with them.

That's why we're thrilled to announce our public launch and our seed funding today. But more importantly, we want to tell you why we exist: to introduce Customer Clarity - imagine understanding exactly what your customers think, need, and value.

## Let's Talk About Understanding (and Growth)

We all know the gap between what we think customers want and what they actually need. The endless meetings. The competing priorities. The second-guessing. We've all been there.

But what if you could close that gap? What if your entire organization could move forward with absolute clarity about what customers truly need?

That's why we built Perspective AI. To give every business the customer clarity they need to grow with confidence, and to give each of your customers a seat at the table.

When you truly understand your customers, you stop guessing and start growing:

- Build products and features like Taylor Swift - hit after hit after hit. When you truly understand what customers want, your product releases become chart-toppers, not one-hit wonders. Every feature lands because it's exactly what your audience has been waiting for.

- Sell like a champion boxer - win without taking punches. When you know exactly what customers value, your sales team doesn't just win more - they win easier. No more long, draining battles or price wars. Just clean wins because you're selling exactly what customers need.

- Deliver results that speak for themselves - 150% net revenue retention and near-zero escalations. When you understand your customers' goals, they don't just stay - they grow with you. That's the power of clarity: happy customers who expand their business because you're delivering exactly what they need.

- And when everyone has Customer Clarity? Magic happens. Product builds what sales can't wait to sell. Sales promises what delivery loves to implement. Customer success drives insights that product turns into the next big hit. It's a virtuous cycle where every team builds on each other's success - all because everyone truly understands what customers need.


## Bringing Every Voice to the Table

Traditionally, companies have relied on deep conversations with their closest customers and executives, supplemented by surveys and feedback forms for broader reach. While these conversations are invaluable, scaling this level of understanding across your entire customer base has been impossible.

Until now.

How do we change this? By having rich, meaningful conversations with all of your customers, frequently, keeping the dialog open. That's where Perspective AI comes in.

When we first considered using AI to power customer conversations, we had concerns. Would customers engage meaningfully? After all, people are increasingly resistant to traditional surveys - they're tired of transactional relationships and checkbox exercises.

That's why we designed our Perspective AI to extend your relationships with your customers through meaningful dialogue - giving every customer the opportunity to be heard, understood, and valued. The results? Over 10,000 customer conversations completed with a 90% completion rate. Customers aren't just participating - they're engaging in rich, insightful discussions that deliver real understanding.

Here's how it works:
- Customer Conversations at Scale: We help you have genuine, back-and-forth conversations with customers, asking the right follow-up questions to uncover what really matters
- True Customer Understanding: These conversations give you the full picture - not just what customers think, but why they think it
- Customer Clarity: With this deep understanding, you make decisions with confidence, not hope
