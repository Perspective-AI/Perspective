# Product Updates: July 10th, 2025

The latest release from Perspective AI continues our commitment to simplifying research creation, deepening insights, and increasing speed to value. This month, we're rolling out four powerful updates that make it easier than ever to generate research conversations, work with grounded quotes, personalize your interview voice, and invite participants in bulk.

Let’s take a look.

---

## Grounding That Goes Deeper

### Grounded Quotes in Analysis
Now every quote in your analysis is linked back to the full interview context. Just click on any quote and the entire conversation opens in a side panel—no more jumping between tabs or guessing where something came from.

Whether you're validating insights or digging into nuance, full context is just one click away.

## Conversation Creation: Now Even Smarter

### Generate Test Conversations with One Click
Need sample interviews to validate your setup or train your team? You can now generate 5 simulated interviews instantly—right from the conversation creation screen. These aren't filler—they’re realistic, representative, and ready to use.

## Personalized Research, Powered by Voice

### Six Voice Models to Choose From
Whether you're interviewing executives or everyday users, tone matters. That’s why you can now choose from 6 distinct voice models in your research guide settings. Test which one works best for your audience—or match the voice to your brand tone.

## Scaling Invitations Just Got Simpler

### Paste and Invite from a List
Bulk recruiting just got a huge upgrade. You can now copy and paste a list of emails directly into the invite tool and send invites at scale. No manual entry. No CSVs. Just paste, select, and launch.
