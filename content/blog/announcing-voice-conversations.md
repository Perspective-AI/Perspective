## Their voice matters. Now it's easier to hear it.

At Perspective AI, we believe the most powerful insights come from your customers' genuine expressions. Today, we're introducing Voice Conversations — designed around the most natural way people communicate.

## They say it. Don't type it.

Voice Conversations removes the barrier between your customers' thoughts and their expression. No more typing constraints. No more edited responses. Just natural speech that captures authentic feedback.
- **10× higher response rates** than traditional surveys
- **Deeper, more nuanced insights** that text alone can't convey
- **Effortless sharing** that feels like a real conversation

## Designed for authentic customer connection

We've meticulously crafted every aspect of Voice Conversations to respect how your customers naturally communicate:
- **Immediate and responsive** — from thoughts to insights in seconds
- **Emotionally intelligent** — captures the nuances text misses
- **Beautifully simple** — they just talk, we handle the rest

## The experience makes the difference

"It's a Siri or Alexa for your voice of customer program," shares one early user. Another notes, "You'll get longer, more in-depth responses because people can talk a lot easier than they can type."
Voice Conversations isn't just a feature — it's a fundamentally better way to understand your customers. It's the difference between reading their words and hearing their stories.

## Try it to believe it

Some innovations need to be experienced to be understood. Voice Conversations is one of them.
