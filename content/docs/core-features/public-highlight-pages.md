# Public Highlight Pages

## How It Works

### 1. Complete Your Interviews & Analysis

Before you can create a highlight page, you need completed interviews or data. Run an analysis session and use Perspective AI to generate assets such as research reports, guides, or case studies.

### 2. Save Key Insights as Highlights

- In your analysis session, click the **Highlight** button on any section or output you want to save as a resource.
- Highlights are instantly saved to your session’s **Resources Drawer**.

### 3. Review & Edit Highlights

- Click any saved highlight in the resources drawer to open and review it.
- Use the **Edit** button to modify the content, update the title, or add supporting details.
- For more advanced edits, open the **Page Properties** tab to:
  - Change the page title and description
  - Upload or update a hero image
  - Adjust Open Graph (OG) meta data for better sharing/link previews

### 4. Share or Publish

- **Internal sharing:** Use the **Share Highlight** option for resources you want to keep within your organization or project (not public).
- **Public sharing:** Select **Publish Page** to generate a public, shareable link. This makes your highlight visible to anyone with the link.

### 5. Manage Highlights

- All highlights are organized in the **Highlights** tab of the research menu for each perspective/session.
- From here, you can:
  - Edit content or properties
  - Unpublish pages
  - Delete or duplicate highlights
  - Access all saved, internal, and published highlights in one place

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Add context:** Use titles, executive summaries, and hero images to help readers quickly understand what your highlight page covers.
- **Keep it focused:** Each highlight page should deliver a single, clear insight or resource for easier sharing and reference.
- **Use OG meta data:** Make your public links look great on Slack, LinkedIn, and X by uploading a hero image and writing a compelling description.
- **Version control:** For living documents, update and republish your page as new data or insights emerge.
- **Permission reminders:** Only publish externally if your data is cleared for public consumption.
