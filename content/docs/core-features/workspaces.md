# Perspective Workspaces: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Perspective becomes even more powerful when used collaboratively. As your team grows and your projects multiply, staying organized is crucial. This is where Workspaces come in - a simple yet effective solution for grouping related Perspectives and managing team access.

Workspaces allow you to:

1. Organize Perspectives logically (e.g., by client, project, or department)
2. Control access and permissions for team members
3. Streamline collaboration on shared projects
4. Manage multiple accounts or initiatives separately

Whether you're a small team or a large organization, Workspaces provide the structure and flexibility needed to make the most of Perspective's collaborative features. In this guide, we'll walk you through creating and managing Workspaces, inviting team members, and understanding the permission structure.

## Workspace Permissions Explained

Once your team member has accepted the email invite, they'll have access to the workspace. What they'll be able to do within that workspace is defined below.

> **NOTE:** Any user, whether they are a workspace owner or member, will not be able to access or manage ANY Perspective where they are not a collaborator. Either by direct invite or implicitly by granting Workspace-level access.
