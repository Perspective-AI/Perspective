# Trust Assessment: Ensuring Research Integrity Through Participant Validation

## What is Trust Assessment?

Trust Assessment is Perspective AI's automated fraud detection system that evaluates interview participants for authenticity and trustworthiness. This AI-powered feature analyzes multiple participant signals to help you identify potentially fraudulent respondents and maintain the integrity of your research data.

## Why Trust Assessment Matters

Research integrity depends on authentic participant responses. Fraudulent participants can:
- Skew your research findings with inaccurate data
- Waste valuable research budget on unreliable insights
- Compromise decision-making based on flawed data
- Damage the credibility of your research outcomes

Trust Assessment helps you identify these risks before they impact your research, ensuring you can make confident decisions based on verified participant data.

## How Trust Assessment Works

### Automated Analysis
Once an interview is completed, Trust Assessment automatically analyzes the participant across multiple trust dimensions using advanced AI. The system examines various signals including:

- **Identity Verification**: Validates provided personal information and professional profiles
- **Role & Experience Relevance**: Assesses whether the participant's background aligns with research requirements
- **Technical Signals Consistency**: Examines IP addresses, timezones, and device information for consistency
- **Response Quality & Engagement**: Evaluates the depth, relevance, and authenticity of responses
- **Eligibility Criteria Confirmation**: Verifies that participants meet your specific research criteria

### Comprehensive Scoring System
Each trust dimension receives:
- **Individual Score** (0-100): Specific assessment for that dimension
- **Confidence Level** (Low/Medium/High): How certain the AI is about its evaluation
- **Detailed Reasoning**: Explanation of factors influencing the score
- **Overall Assessment** (0-100): Combined trust score across all dimensions

### Actionable Recommendations
The system provides specific verification steps you can take, such as:
- Verifying LinkedIn profiles or professional credentials
- Confirming specific eligibility criteria (e.g., company size, tool usage)
- Cross-checking technical signals for consistency

## Understanding Your Trust Assessment Results

### Trust Score Interpretation
- **High Scores (80-100)**: Participant shows strong trust signals across multiple dimensions
- **Medium Scores (60-79)**: Some concerns identified, but participant may still be reliable with verification
- **Low Scores (0-59)**: Significant trust concerns detected, recommend careful review or exclusion

### Summary Classifications
Trust Assessment provides clear guidance with summaries starting with either:
- **"Trustworthy"**: Participant demonstrates strong authenticity signals
- **"Suspicious"**: Multiple red flags detected requiring further investigation

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence**: Strong evidence supporting the assessment
- **Medium Confidence**: Good indicators but some uncertainty remains
- **Low Confidence**: Limited data available for definitive assessment

## When to Use Trust Assessment

### Automatic Activation
Trust Assessment runs automatically on all completed interviews, providing immediate fraud detection without manual intervention.

### Re-running Assessments
You can manually re-run Trust Assessment if:
- New information becomes available about a participant
- You want a fresh analysis with updated AI models
- Initial assessment had low confidence and you need verification

### Integration with Research Workflow
Use Trust Assessment results to:
- **Filter participants** before including data in analysis
- **Weight responses** based on trust scores in your findings
- **Flag interviews** that require manual review
- **Validate sample quality** across your entire research project

## Best Practices

### Review All Dimensions
Don't rely solely on the overall scoreâ€”examine individual trust dimensions to understand specific concerns or strengths.

### Act on Recommendations
Follow the specific verification steps provided to increase confidence in borderline cases.

### Consider Context
Factor in your research requirements and risk tolerance when interpreting scores. Critical research may require higher trust thresholds.

### Document Decisions
Keep records of how Trust Assessment influenced your participant inclusion decisions for research transparency.

## Technical Reliability

Trust Assessment leverages advanced AI models specifically trained for fraud detection in research contexts. The system:
- Analyzes patterns across thousands of data points
- Continuously improves through machine learning
- Provides transparent reasoning for all assessments
- Maintains high accuracy rates in identifying fraudulent participants
