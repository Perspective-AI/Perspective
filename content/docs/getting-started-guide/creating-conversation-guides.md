## Creating a Conversation Outline

To create a new conversation outline, navigate to the Home section. Here you'll either:

- Write your own research question
- Start from a template

After you've selected a template or written your own conversation topic, Perspective will launch into an conversation experience where it will ask you questions to gain a better understanding of your goals.

At the end of the conversation, you'll have a complete conversation guide.

> ### The conversation Process
>
> The conversation process usually takes less than 3 minutes and covers:
>
> - The purpose of the conversation
> - Who you are and how this conversation is related to your role
> - Who you'll be chatting with
> - Mandatory questions for participants

## Trying the Conversation Experience

Once you've finished creating your conversation guide, you have the ability to try the conversation as though you were one of the  participants. We always recommend trying the conversation before moving on to invite participants.

If you want to make changes to the conversation guide after trying it, simply tell Perspective what you'd like to change. Perspective will generate an updated conversation guide with each additional prompt you give it.

Once you're happy with the conversation experience, it's time to move to the next step.

## Customizing the Conversation Experience

To ensure the highest number of completed conversations as possible, it is recommended that you customize the theme and interaction settings to clearly communicate the purpose of the conversation to participants and align the conversation experience with your brand.

### Customize Interaction Settings
The interaction settings allow you to customize the following:

- **External Conversation Title and Welcome Message** - This is the first thing participants see after they click on the invite link.
- **On Behalf Of** - This is the person or organization who Perspective is conducting the conversation on behalf of (e.g., "John Smith," "Acme Co.").
- **Byline** - Used to communicate additional context about you or your organization (e.g., "SVP of Product," or "Customer Experience Team").
- **Call To Action** - Optionally display a custom button at the end of the conversation. Use this to direct participants to your company website, rewards site, or any other website of your choosing.
- **Thank You Email** - You can send a thank you email to participants after they've completed the conversation (we recommend this).
- **Allow Anonymous Participants** - Toggle this on at the bottom of the interaction settings (we generally don't recommend this unless there are specific circumstances that require it).

### Theme Settings
Theme settings control the visual elements of the participant's conversation experience and enables you to ensure it aligns with your organization's branding. Specifically, you can do the following:

- Add a light mode logo (displayed when conversation participants are using light mode in their browser)
- Add a dark mode logo (displayed when conversation participants are using dark mode in their browser)
- Set a theme color

After you've configured the theme settings, we recommend trying the sample conversation again to make sure everything looks good.

Once you've finished customizing the branding settings, you're ready to move on to the next step.

## Inviting Participants

The final step is to invite participants. There are four methods to choose from:

- Invite via email
- Copy a link
- Post the link on social media (LinkedIn, ùïè, Facebook, Gmail)
- Generate and send a QR code

You can mix and match these methods and send/resend as many times as you'd like.
