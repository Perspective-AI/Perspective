# Introduction
Setting up your Perspective profile is an important first step that ensures Perspective will generate the best possible research outlines and interview questions.
Your Perspective profile consists of the following:

- [Avatar](#avatar)
- [Name](#name)
- [Personalized Bio](#personalized-bio)
- [Role](#role)

## Avatar
Highly personalized interviews have a 3x higher completion rate than non-personalized ones. When interview participants see your avatar, they know that it's coming from someone they trust.
To upload your avatar navigate to Settings > Profile, then select "Choose file."

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Avatars must be .jpg or .png files with a maximum size of 4MB.

## Name
Perspective asks for two names:

- Full name
- Preferred name

Your full name is what Perspective uses by default in welcome messages and emails sent to your interview participants.

Your preferred name is how Perspective will refer to you during your interactions with it.

## Personalized Bio
You have the ability to personalize Perspective with context about yourself, your company, and your objectives. This information is used to improve Perspective-generated research plans and interview questions, ensuring the best possible experience for you and the people who Perspective interviews on your behalf. 

If you're not sure what to add, copy this template and fill in the blanks:

> - My company is {company name}. We make {product description} for {customer description}.
> - I am a {your role}. My primary areas of focus are {area 1, area 2, etc.}.
> - I am located in {country/ state} and my primary language is {primary language}.
> - My primary use cases for Perspective are {use case1, use case 2, etc.}, though I may occasionally use it for other things.
> - My goals with Perspective are {goal 1, goal 2, etc.}.

## Role
Similar to the personalized bio, your role is used for context building and to provide you with highly relevant prompt suggestions. If you'd like, you can disable this setting at the bottom of the profile settings page.
