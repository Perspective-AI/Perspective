## Step-by-step process of conducting an analysis session
1. In the left-hand menu, navigate to "Perspectives."
2. Open the Perspective that you want to analyze and click "New Analysis Session."

3. Tell Perspective what you'd like to know. Here are a few examples:
    * "What are the top 5 areas we can improve?"
    * "What content do users say we're missing?"
    * "Show me the top 3 reasons customers are churning."
    * "How can this content be improved?"
4. Once you've identified insights you'd like to share with your team, click the "highlight" button, then click "share" to send it to your colleagues.

# Visualize Interview Insights with Charts
Visualizing feedback as a chart is as simple as asking Perspective to make it for you. Here are some examples to get you started:
* Visualize interview participants' sentiment
* Show me a distribution of NPS scores
* Create a chart of customer satisfaction rankings
* Make a stack-ranked chart of the top 5 interview themes

# Transform Feedback into Content
Perspective isn't just for collecting customer feedback on your products and services. You can also use it to collect feedback on content like blog posts, videos, emails, and more. After you've created a research outline and collected interview responses, follow these steps:

* Start a new analysis session
* Ask Perspective something like, "What are the top 5 ways that this blog post can be improved?"
* Read over Perspective's analysis and make sure you agree with its assessment (if you think it's wrong, just tell it to try again).
* Copy and paste your original content (in this example, the first draft of the blog post) into the chat and tell Perspective to "rewrite this blog post based on this assessment."
* Watch in amazement as Perspective incorporates your team's feedback and generates a new version in seconds.

Here's a 5-minute video demonstrating how we use Perspective to collect feedback and make improvements to our YouTube videos:
