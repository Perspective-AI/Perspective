Hey there! Nate from Perspective here. First, I just want to say thanks for signing up for Perspective. It really means a lot to us. In this guide, I'm going to show you how to use Perspective AI to gather feedback.

## Creating a Research Outline

The first step is to create a new research outline. This is crucial for context building and ensures that Perspective asks the right questions to get you the insights you're looking for.

1. Head to the home page.
2. You'll see two options:
   - Choose a recommended research question
   - Write your own

Let's say you're a product manager wanting to know why customers are churning. You might type an initial research question like: "Why are customers canceling their subscription?"

## The Interview Process

Perspective will now interview you to create the research outline. This process usually takes less than 3 minutes and covers:

- The purpose of the research
- Who you'll be interviewing
- Any specific hypotheses you have
- Mandatory questions for participants

At the end, you'll have a complete research outline.

## Customizing Your Research

After creating your outline, you can:

1. Try the interview yourself to understand the participant experience
2. Customize interview settings:
   - Add a custom welcome message
   - Include a custom CTA button for your rewards platform
   - Update colors and add a logo for brand consistency

If you need to modify the outline content, simply continue chatting with Perspective and specify the changes.

## Inviting Participants

Once you're satisfied with your research setup, you're ready to invite participants. You can:

- Invite via email
- Post the link on social media
- Generate and send a QR code

## Wrapping Up

That's it! Now you can sit back and watch the interviews come flying in. Thanks again for choosing Perspective, and happy researching!
