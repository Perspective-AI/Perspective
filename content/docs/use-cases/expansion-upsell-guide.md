# How to Use Perspective AI for Expansion & Upsell Opportunity Identification

Your expansion revenue is unpredictable. Customer success teams struggle to identify upsell opportunities. Expansion conversations feel pushy rather than value-driven. You're missing revenue growth from existing customers because you don't understand their evolving needs.

**Perspective AI transforms expansion strategy from sales-driven pitches into customer-driven growth** by conducting AI-powered interviews with existing customers‚Äîrevealing genuine expansion needs, growth triggers, and value-based upsell opportunities that align customer success with revenue expansion.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Identified genuine expansion opportunities** based on customer needs rather than sales quotas
- **Value-driven upsell strategies** that customers see as helpful rather than pushy
- **Expansion trigger recognition** that enables proactive rather than reactive growth conversations
- **Customer-aligned revenue growth** that strengthens relationships while increasing account value

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your expansion opportunity research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we identify and develop expansion opportunities that deliver genuine value to customers?"
   - "What evolving needs and growth triggers indicate when customers are ready for expansion?"
   - "How can we align customer success with revenue expansion through value-driven upselling?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand customer growth patterns and expansion readiness indicators") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Existing customers across different growth stages and expansion potential
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent expansion opportunity data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "How has your business or use of our product evolved since you first started with us?"
- "What new challenges or opportunities are you facing that might require additional capabilities?"
- "If you could add one thing to your current plan that would significantly impact your results, what would it be?"
- "What would need to change in your situation for you to consider investing more in solutions like ours?"
- "How do you evaluate whether new tools or capabilities are worth the additional investment?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover business evolution and genuine expansion needs rather than just asking about willingness to spend more.
