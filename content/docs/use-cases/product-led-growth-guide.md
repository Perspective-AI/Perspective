# How to Use Perspective AI for Product-Led Growth & Expansion Strategy

Your growth is driven by sales and marketing spend, not product value. Users love your product but don't invite teammates. Account expansion happens through sales calls, not natural product usage. You're missing opportunities for viral growth and organic expansion built into the product experience.

**Perspective AI transforms growth strategy from acquisition-focused to product-led** by conducting AI-powered interviews with power users, decision-makers, and expanding accounts‚Äîrevealing how customers naturally share, expand usage, and upgrade based on product value rather than sales pressure.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of how customers naturally expand and share your product
- **Identified growth levers** built into product usage patterns and workflows
- **Expansion triggers** that predict when accounts are ready for upgrades or additional seats
- **Viral mechanisms** that can be embedded in the product experience to drive organic growth

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your product-led growth research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we design product experiences that drive organic growth and account expansion?"
   - "What motivates customers to share our product with colleagues and expand usage within their organization?"
   - "Which product usage patterns predict successful account expansion and upgrade behavior?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand the triggers that cause customers to expand product usage") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Customer demographics across different expansion and sharing behaviors
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent product-led growth data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "Tell me about how your use of our product has grown or changed since you first started. What drove those expansions?"
- "Have you shared or recommended our product to colleagues? What motivated you to do that, and how did you explain it?"
- "What would need to happen for you to upgrade to a higher tier or add more seats? What value would justify that investment?"
- "When you think about expanding how your team uses our product, what obstacles or concerns come to mind?"
- "Describe a moment when our product became more valuable to you. What changed, and how did that affect your usage?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover natural expansion behaviors and sharing motivations rather than just asking about willingness to pay more.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Help Us Understand Growth Patterns: Share Your Product Expansion Experience"
- **Welcome Message**: "I'd love to understand how your use of our product has evolved and what drives you to expand or share it with others. This AI-guided conversation helps us design better growth experiences built into the product itself. Your insights shape how we help customers grow with our platform."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Product Manager, Growth Research, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Want early access to new expansion features based on this research? Join our growth beta program" + sign-up link
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain engagement
- **Require sign-in**: Recommended for usage data correlation and account analysis
- **Access level**: Keep as "Account" (visible to your team only)

---

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants across growth behaviors:**
- **Power users**: Heavy users who've expanded usage significantly over time
- **Account champions**: Users who've successfully brought colleagues onto the product
- **Recent expanders**: Accounts that recently upgraded tiers or added seats
- **Decision makers**: People with budget authority who influence expansion decisions
- **Cross-functional users**: People using your product for different purposes than original intent
- **Viral sharers**: Users who frequently share or demonstrate your product to others

**Choose your outreach method:**

**Link Sharing** (Most common):
- Copy the unique conversation link
- Send via email, customer success touchpoints, or account management
- Position as research to improve growth and expansion experiences

**Email Integration**:
- Use built-in email invitations
- Send directly from Perspective AI platform

**Sample invitation message:**

## Real-World Example

**Company:** Collaboration software with freemium model targeting creative teams

**Research Question:** "How can we design product experiences that drive organic team adoption and account expansion?"

**Participants:** 41 users across power users (15), account champions (12), recent expanders (9), and decision makers (5)

**Key Product-Led Growth Findings:**
- **Collaboration moments** drove 78% of colleague invitations‚Äîwhen users needed input on shared projects
- **Success showcasing** motivated sharing‚Äîusers wanted to demonstrate results to stakeholders
- **Workflow integration** predicted expansion‚Äîteams that embedded product in daily workflows upgraded 3x more
- **Template sharing** created viral loops‚Äîusers sharing templates with external collaborators brought new accounts
- **Storage limits** were expansion triggers for 65% of upgrades, but feature limits drove only 23%
- **ROI realization** took 3-4 weeks‚Äîexpansion decisions happened after value was proven, not during trial

**Natural Growth Patterns Identified:**
1. **Individual adoption** ‚Üí **Project collaboration** ‚Üí **Team standardization** ‚Üí **Organization rollout**
2. **External sharing** ‚Üí **Client/vendor adoption** ‚Üí **Cross-company viral growth**
3. **Department success** ‚Üí **Internal showcasing** ‚Üí **Other department adoption**

**Viral Mechanisms Discovered:**
- Users naturally shared **completed projects** to show results (89% did this)
- **Template libraries** were frequently shared with industry peers
- **Client presentation mode** led to external adoption in 34% of cases
- **Export/sharing features** created touchpoints with non-users

**Expansion Friction Points:**
- **Pricing perception**: Users thought team plans were "for big companies"
- **Feature confusion**: Didn't understand which features required upgrades
- **Decision process**: Individual users lacked authority for team purchases
- **Migration concerns**: Worried about disrupting existing workflows

**Strategic Actions Taken:**
1. **Built-in Collaboration**: Made real-time collaboration the default experience, not optional

## FAQs

**Q: How do I balance viral features with user privacy and experience?**
A: Focus on features that users naturally want to share (results, templates, insights) rather than forced sharing. Make sharing valuable for both sender and recipient.

**Q: What if my product doesn't seem naturally viral or social?**
A: Look for workflow moments where users need input, approval, or collaboration. Even "individual" tools often have sharing moments around results or decision-making.

**Q: How do I design expansion triggers that don't feel pushy or sales-driven?**
A: Time upgrade prompts with natural value realization moments and workflow friction points. Focus on removing obstacles rather than pushing upgrades.

**Q: Should product-led growth replace traditional sales for expansion?**
A: It should complement sales by creating more qualified expansion opportunities and reducing friction in the expansion process. Sales can focus on larger, more complex deals.
