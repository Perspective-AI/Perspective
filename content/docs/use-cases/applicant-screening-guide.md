# How to Use Perspective AI for Applicant Screening & Pre-Interview Assessment

You're spending too much time interviewing unqualified candidates. Resume screening doesn't reveal cultural fit or genuine interest. Phone screens are time-consuming and often miss key qualification details. Your hiring team wastes interview slots on candidates who aren't right for the role or company.

**Perspective AI transforms applicant screening from resume-based guesswork into comprehensive candidate assessment** by conducting AI-powered pre-interview conversations with job applicants‚Äîgathering detailed qualification information, assessing cultural fit, and enabling hiring teams to make informed interview decisions that improve hiring efficiency and outcomes.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Comprehensive candidate qualification** beyond what resumes reveal before investing interview time
- **Cultural fit assessment** that identifies alignment with company values and team dynamics
- **Improved interview efficiency** by focusing time on genuinely qualified and interested candidates
- **Better hiring decisions** through systematic candidate evaluation and comparison
