# How to Use Perspective AI for Sales Demo & Call Preparation

Your sales team goes into demos blind. Discovery calls are rushed and surface-level. Prospects receive generic pitches that don't address their specific needs. Demo conversion rates are inconsistent because reps don't have enough context about prospect situations.

**Perspective AI transforms demo preparation from generic presentations into personalized conversations** by conducting AI-powered pre-call interviews with prospects using proven qualification frameworks‚Äîgathering critical context that enables sales teams to deliver targeted demos and pitches that resonate with specific prospect needs.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Comprehensive prospect qualification** using BANT, MEDDIC, or other frameworks before sales calls
- **Personalized demo preparation** based on prospect-specific needs, challenges, and decision criteria
- **Higher conversion rates** from better-prepared, more relevant sales conversations
- **Improved sales efficiency** with pre-qualified leads and customized sales approaches

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your sales demo preparation research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we better understand prospect needs before sales calls to deliver more personalized and effective demos?"
   - "What qualification information do we need to customize our sales approach for each prospect?"
   - "How can we improve demo conversion rates through better prospect preparation and understanding?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Gather comprehensive prospect qualification information using BANT/MEDDIC frameworks") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Prospects who have scheduled upcoming sales calls or demos
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent sales qualification data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your qualification framework:**

**For BANT Framework:**
- "What specific business challenges are you hoping to solve, and what's driving the urgency to address them now?"
- "Who else is involved in evaluating and deciding on this type of solution?"
- "What budget range have you allocated for solving this problem?"
- "What's your ideal timeline for implementing a solution?"

**For MEDDIC Framework:**
- "What business metrics would you use to measure success with a new solution?"
- "Who is the economic buyer with final decision authority on this purchase?"
- "What criteria will you use to evaluate different solutions?"
- "What specific pain points is this solution meant to address?"
- "Who is your internal champion for this initiative?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions from your preferred qualification framework that uncover the most critical information for demo customization.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Pre-Demo Preparation: Help Us Customize Your Upcoming Sales Call"
- **Welcome Message**: "Thanks for scheduling a demo with our team! To make sure we use your time effectively and focus on what matters most to you, this quick conversation will help us understand your specific needs and challenges. This ensures our upcoming demo is relevant and valuable for your situation."

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Thank you! We'll use these insights to customize your demo. Looking forward to our upcoming call" + meeting confirmation link
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable with demo preparation summary

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants for demo preparation:**

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
