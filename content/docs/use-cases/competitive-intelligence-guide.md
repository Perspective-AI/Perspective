# How to Use Perspective AI for Competitive Intelligence & Market Positioning

Your sales team loses deals but can't pinpoint why. Marketing messages that test well internally fall flat with prospects. You know competitors are winning business, but you're guessing at their advantages and your weaknesses.

**Perspective AI transforms competitive guesswork into data-driven insights** by conducting AI-powered interviews with customers who have evaluated multiple vendors‚Äîrevealing exactly how buyers perceive your brand, what drives their decisions, and where you can gain competitive advantage.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of how customers perceive your brand versus competitors
- **Decision criteria insights** that reveal what really matters to buyers
- **Positioning opportunities** based on competitive gaps and strengths
- **Actionable strategies** to differentiate and win more deals

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your competitive intelligence research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai](https://getperspective.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How do customers perceive our brand versus competitors and what drives their vendor selection decisions?"
   - "What factors most influence buyer decisions in our market category?"
   - "Where do we have competitive advantages and blind spots in customer perception?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand decision criteria that drive vendor selection") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Customer demographics and evaluation criteria
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent competitive data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "Walk me through your vendor evaluation process‚Äîwhat stages did you go through and what mattered most at each step?"
- "How would you describe the key differences between [Your Company] and [Top Competitor] in your own words?"
- "What would have needed to change about our offering to make it your clear first choice?"
- "If you were advising a peer going through a similar vendor selection, what would you tell them to prioritize?"
- "What concerns or hesitations did you have about our company that other vendors didn't trigger?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover decision criteria and perception gaps rather than just feature comparisons.

---

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Share Your Vendor Evaluation Experience: Help Us Understand Buyer Perspectives"
- **Welcome Message**: "I'd love to understand your experience evaluating solutions in our market. This AI-guided conversation will help us better serve customers like you. Your honest insights about different vendors and decision factors are invaluable."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (consider using "Market Research" rather than specific company role), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Interested in seeing how we're improving based on this feedback? Schedule a brief update call" + calendar link
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain relationship
- **Require sign-in**: Optional - consider pros/cons of anonymity vs. follow-up
- **Access level**: Keep as "Account" (visible to your team only)

---

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants:**
- **Recent evaluators**: Customers who evaluated 2+ vendors in past 6-12 months
- **Decision influencers**: People involved in vendor selection (not just end users)
- **Mixed outcomes**: Include customers who chose you AND those who chose competitors
- **Diverse segments**: Different company sizes, industries, or use cases

**Choose your outreach method:**

**Link Sharing** (Most common):
- Copy the unique conversation link
- Send via email, LinkedIn, or through customer success teams
- Position as market research rather than sales follow-up

**Email Integration**:
- Use built-in email invitations
- Send directly from Perspective AI platform

**Sample invitation message:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm conducting research on how companies evaluate vendors in [your market category]. Your experience comparing different solutions would provide valuable insights. This AI-guided conversation takes 10-15 minutes and helps the industry better understand buyer needs. Would you be willing to share your perspective? [insert link]"

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
- Emphasize market research benefit, not company-specific gains
- Reach out 2-6 months after their decision (not too fresh, not too stale)
- Consider small incentives (Amazon gift cards, industry reports)
- Use warm introductions when possible
