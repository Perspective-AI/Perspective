# How to Use Perspective AI for Customer Onboarding & Time-to-Value Optimization

New customers sign up but don't achieve first value quickly enough. Onboarding completion rates are low. Time-to-value varies wildly between customers. You're losing customers during the critical first 90 days because they don't see ROI fast enough.

**Perspective AI transforms onboarding optimization from assumption-based processes into customer-driven experiences** by conducting AI-powered interviews with new customers, successful adopters, and struggling users‚Äîrevealing onboarding friction points, value realization barriers, and optimization strategies that accelerate customer success.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Optimized onboarding process** that accelerates time-to-first-value for new customers
- **Identified friction points** that prevent successful customer adoption and engagement
- **Personalized onboarding strategies** for different customer segments and use cases
- **Improved retention rates** through better early-stage customer success and value realization

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your onboarding optimization research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we optimize our customer onboarding process to reduce time-to-value and increase adoption rates?"
   - "What friction points prevent new customers from achieving success during onboarding?"
   - "How can we better support customers during their first 90 days to improve retention and satisfaction?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Identify the key factors that accelerate customer time-to-value") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: New and recent customers across different onboarding outcomes and experiences
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent onboarding optimization data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "Walk me through your onboarding experience from day one‚Äîwhat went smoothly and where did you get stuck?"
- "When did you first realize real value from our product, and what made that moment possible?"
- "What would have helped you achieve success faster during your first few weeks with us?"
- "If you were designing our onboarding process, what would you change to help new customers like yourself?"
- "What expectations did you have for onboarding that weren't met, and what exceeded your expectations?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover the customer's journey to value and specific onboarding improvement opportunities.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Onboarding Experience Feedback: Help Us Improve New Customer Success"
- **Welcome Message**: "We'd love to understand your onboarding experience to help us improve how we support new customers. Your insights about what worked well and what could be better would be incredibly valuable for enhancing our customer success process."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Customer Success, Onboarding Specialist, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants across onboarding spectrum:**
- **Recently onboarded customers**: Those who completed onboarding in the past 30-90 days
- **Currently onboarding**: New customers actively going through the onboarding process
- **Successful early adopters**: Customers who achieved first value quickly and are highly engaged
- **Struggling customers**: Those who are having difficulty with onboarding or low engagement
- **Different customer segments**: Various company sizes, industries, or use case types

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
- Send from customer success contacts who have built rapport with customers
