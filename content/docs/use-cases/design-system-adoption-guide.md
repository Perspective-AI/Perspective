# How to Use Perspective AI for Design System Adoption & Usage Analysis

Your design system exists but isn't being used consistently. Teams create one-off designs instead of using system components. Adoption varies wildly across teams and projects. You're not sure why some teams embrace the system while others ignore it entirely.

**Perspective AI transforms design system optimization from usage metrics into behavioral insights** by conducting AI-powered interviews with designers, developers, and product teams‚Äîrevealing adoption barriers, usage patterns, and system improvements that drive consistent design and efficient collaboration across the organization.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of why teams do or don't adopt design system components
- **Identified adoption barriers** that prevent consistent usage across teams and projects
- **Usage optimization strategies** that increase design system value and team efficiency
- **System improvement priorities** based on real user needs rather than theoretical best practices

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand design system usage patterns and adoption barriers across teams") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Internal team members across design, development, and product roles
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent design system adoption data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your team structure:**

**For Designers:**
- "Walk me through your typical design process‚Äîwhen do you use design system components versus creating new elements?"
- "What aspects of our design system help your workflow versus create friction or limitations?"
- "When you need to deviate from the design system, what drives that decision and how do you handle it?"

**For Developers:**
- "How do you typically implement designs‚Äîdo you use design system code components or build custom solutions?"
- "What makes design system components easy or difficult to work with in your development process?"
- "When you encounter design system gaps or limitations, what's your usual approach to solving them?"

**For Product Teams:**
- "How does design system consistency (or inconsistency) impact your product development and user experience goals?"
- "What role does the design system play in your team's ability to ship features quickly and maintain quality?"
- "How do you balance design system adherence with product-specific needs and timeline pressures?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover workflow realities and decision-making processes rather than just asking about satisfaction with the system.
