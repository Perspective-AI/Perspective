# How to Use Perspective AI for Customer Support & Service Experience Enhancement

Your support metrics look good, but customer satisfaction with support is declining. You know ticket resolution times but not the customer experience quality. Support interactions create more frustration than resolution. You're optimizing support processes based on internal efficiency rather than customer outcomes.

**Perspective AI transforms support optimization from metrics-driven improvements into customer-centered service excellence** by conducting AI-powered interviews with customers who have recently interacted with support‚Äîrevealing service experience quality, identifying process improvements, and optimizing support delivery for better customer outcomes and sustainable operational efficiency.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Customer-centered support insights** that reveal service experience quality beyond resolution metrics
- **Identified service improvement opportunities** based on real customer support experiences
- **Optimized support processes** that balance customer satisfaction with operational efficiency
- **Enhanced service delivery** that turns support interactions into positive customer experiences

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your customer support experience research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we improve our customer support experience to increase satisfaction and reduce effort for customers?"
   - "What aspects of our support service create positive versus negative customer experiences?"
   - "How can we optimize support delivery to better serve customer needs while maintaining operational efficiency?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand customer support experience quality and improvement opportunities") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Customers who have recently interacted with support services
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent support experience data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on support focus:**

**For Overall Support Experience Assessment:**
- "Walk me through your recent support experience with us from start to finish‚Äîwhat went well and what was challenging?"
- "How did you feel throughout the support process, and how did your emotions change from initial contact to resolution?"
- "What would have made your support experience significantly better or easier?"

**For Specific Support Interaction Analysis:**
- "Describe the quality of communication and help you received from our support team‚Äîwhat worked well versus what could improve?"
- "How well did our support team understand your issue and provide relevant solutions?"
- "What additional information, tools, or support would have helped resolve your issue more effectively?"

**For Support Process and Channel Evaluation:**
- "How easy or difficult was it to get the help you needed through our support channels?"
- "What was your experience with our support process‚Äîfrom finding help to getting your issue resolved?"
- "How does our support experience compare to other companies' support you've used recently?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover both functional support effectiveness and emotional customer experience rather than just satisfaction ratings.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Support Experience Feedback: Help Us Improve Customer Service"
- **Welcome Message**: "We'd love to understand your recent support experience with us to help improve our customer service. Your honest feedback about what worked well and what could be better helps us provide better support for customers like you."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Customer Support Manager, Service Experience, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Thank you for your feedback! If you need any additional support or have questions about your recent case, please don't hesitate to reach out" + support contact information
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain positive support relationships

## Real-World Example

**Company:** SaaS platform with high support volume but declining customer satisfaction scores

**Research Question:** "Why is support satisfaction declining despite good resolution metrics, and how can we improve the customer support experience?"

**Participants:** 84 customers across different support interactions: phone (28), email (22), chat (18), self-service (16)

**Key Support Experience Findings:**
- **Communication quality gaps**: 67% felt support agents didn't fully understand their issues before offering solutions
- **Process friction**: 74% had to repeat information multiple times when transferred or escalated
- **Resolution effectiveness**: 45% received solutions that didn't fully address their underlying problem
- **Channel inconsistency**: 68% experienced different service quality across phone, email, and chat
- **Follow-up gaps**: 83% never received follow-up to confirm their issue was truly resolved
- **Self-service limitations**: 59% tried self-service first but couldn't find relevant solutions

**Support Experience Quality Analysis:**
- **Positive experiences**: Agent expertise, proactive communication, complete problem resolution
- **Negative experiences**: Long wait times, repetitive information requests, incomplete solutions
- **Emotional journey**: Started hopeful, became frustrated with process, ended mixed on resolution
- **Effort assessment**: Customers rated support as "high effort" due to multiple touchpoints and follow-ups

**Channel-Specific Experience Insights:**
- **Phone support**: Best for complex issues but inconsistent quality across agents
- **Email support**: Preferred for non-urgent issues but slow response and poor context tracking
- **Chat support**: Fast initial response but limited for complex problem-solving
- **Self-service**: Fastest when it worked but poor search and outdated information

**Support Process Pain Points:**
1. **Issue diagnosis**: Agents jumped to solutions before understanding root problems
2. **Information handoffs**: Customer context lost during transfers and escalations
3. **Resolution validation**: No verification that solutions actually worked for customers
4. **Knowledge base gaps**: Self-service content didn't match real customer questions
5. **Proactive communication**: Customers left wondering about case status and next steps
6. **Cross-channel continuity**: Support history not accessible across different channels

**Customer Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Better issue understanding**: "Ask more questions before offering solutions"
- **Seamless transfers**: "Don't make me explain my problem again to every new person"
- **Complete solutions**: "Make sure the fix actually works before closing my case"
- **Proactive updates**: "Tell me what's happening and when to expect resolution"
- **Consistent experience**: "Every channel should have the same information and service level"

**Strategic Actions Taken:**
1. **Agent Training Enhancement**: Implemented consultative problem-solving training focused on issue diagnosis
2. **Context Preservation**: Built unified customer case history accessible across all channels
3. **Resolution Verification**: Added follow-up protocols to confirm customer issues were fully resolved
4. **Knowledge Base Overhaul**: Rebuilt self-service content based on actual customer questions and language
5. **Process Standardization**: Created consistent service standards and procedures across all support channels
6. **Proactive Communication**: Implemented case status updates and timeline communication

**8-Month Results:**
- Customer satisfaction with support improved from 6.2 to 8.6 (out of 10)
- Customer effort score decreased 54% with process improvements and better issue resolution
- First-contact resolution increased 43% through better issue diagnosis and agent training

## FAQs

**Q: How do I get honest feedback about support problems without making the support team feel criticized?**
A: Position research as service improvement rather than team evaluation. Focus on process and system improvements that help agents serve customers better.

**Q: Should I interview customers with resolved issues or unresolved problems?**
A: Include both‚Äîresolved cases show what works well, unresolved cases reveal process gaps and improvement opportunities.

**Q: How do I balance customer experience improvements with support operational efficiency?**
A: Look for improvements that enhance both, such as better issue diagnosis (improves customer experience and reduces repeat contacts) or improved self-service (reduces effort for customers and agents).
