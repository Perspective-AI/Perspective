# How to Use Perspective AI for User Experience Research & Design Validation

Your design decisions are based on internal team preferences rather than user feedback. Usability testing is infrequent and expensive. You're not sure if your designs actually solve user problems or create new friction. Stakeholder opinions conflict with user needs, but you lack systematic user research to guide decisions.

**Perspective AI transforms design validation from assumption-based decisions into user-driven insights** by conducting AI-powered interviews with real users, stakeholders, and customers‚Äîrevealing usability issues, user preferences, and design opportunities based on authentic user behavior and needs rather than internal design team assumptions.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Validated design decisions** based on real user feedback and behavior patterns
- **Identified usability issues** before they impact user experience and business metrics
- **User-centered design insights** that guide interface improvements and feature development
- **Systematic user research process** that supports ongoing design optimization and validation

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand user interaction patterns and identify usability friction points") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Users across different experience levels and use cases
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent UX research data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your research focus:**

**For Design Concept Validation:**
- "Walk me through how you would approach [specific task] using this design‚Äîwhat feels intuitive versus confusing?"
- "What's your first impression of this interface, and what questions or concerns come to mind?"
- "How does this design compare to similar tools or interfaces you've used before?"

**For Existing Interface Research:**
- "Show me how you typically accomplish [key task] and where you encounter friction or confusion."
- "What aspects of the current design work well for you, and what would you change to improve your experience?"
- "When you use this interface, what goals are you trying to achieve and how well does the design support those goals?"

**For Prototype Testing:**
- "Try to complete [specific scenario] using this prototype and tell me about your thought process as you go."
- "What expectations do you have for how this should work, and how does the actual experience compare?"
- "If you were explaining this design to a colleague, what would you highlight as strengths or concerns?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover user mental models, task completion patterns, and emotional responses to design elements.
