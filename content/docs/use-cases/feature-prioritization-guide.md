# How to Use Perspective AI for Feature Prioritization & Roadmap Validation

Your backlog is overflowing with feature requests. Sales wants everything "high priority." Support tickets mention dozens of different needs. You're making roadmap decisions based on the loudest voices, not the most important customer problems.

**Perspective AI transforms feature prioritization guesswork into systematic validation** by conducting AI-powered interviews with customers across different segments‚Äîrevealing true feature priorities, usage context, and willingness to pay for capabilities that actually drive business outcomes.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Data-driven roadmap** prioritized by real customer impact, not internal assumptions
- **Clear understanding** of which features drive retention, expansion, and satisfaction
- **Usage context insights** that inform how features should be designed and positioned
- **Willingness to pay data** that connects feature development to revenue potential

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your feature prioritization research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "Which features should we prioritize on our roadmap based on real customer needs and impact?"
   - "What capabilities would have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction and business outcomes?"
   - "How do feature priorities differ across customer segments and use cases?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand which missing capabilities create the most customer friction") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Customer demographics across different usage patterns and segments
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent feature priority data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "Walk me through your typical workflow with our product. Where do you get stuck or wish something worked differently?"
- "If you could add one capability to our product that would significantly improve your results, what would it be and why?"
- "Think about a recent frustrating experience with our product. What feature or improvement would have prevented that?"
- "What would you be willing to pay extra for if it saved you significant time or improved your outcomes?"
- "When you compare our product to alternatives, what capabilities do they have that you wish we had?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover workflow friction and outcome-based feature needs rather than just feature wish lists.
