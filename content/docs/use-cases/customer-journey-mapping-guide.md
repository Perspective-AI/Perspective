# How to Use Perspective AI for Customer Journey Mapping & Experience Optimization

Your customer journey maps are based on internal assumptions rather than real customer experiences. You know satisfaction scores but not the specific touchpoints that drive them. Customer pain points are identified reactively through complaints rather than proactively through journey analysis. Experience optimization efforts target symptoms rather than root causes.

**Perspective AI transforms customer journey mapping from assumption-based diagrams into experience-driven optimization** by conducting AI-powered interviews with customers across different journey stages‚Äîrevealing real touchpoint experiences, emotional drivers, and friction points that enable targeted improvements for better customer satisfaction and business outcomes.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Accurate customer journey maps** based on real customer experiences rather than internal assumptions
- **Identified critical touchpoints** that drive satisfaction, loyalty, and customer outcomes
- **Pain point and friction analysis** that reveals root causes rather than just symptoms
- **Optimization priorities** that focus effort on changes with highest customer impact

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your customer journey mapping research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "How can we map and optimize the customer journey to reduce friction and improve satisfaction at key touchpoints?"
   - "What are the critical moments and experiences that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty throughout our customer journey?"
   - "Where in the customer journey do we create friction versus delight, and how can we optimize these touchpoints?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand customer experience and emotions at key journey touchpoints") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Customers across different journey stages and experience types
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent customer journey data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on journey focus:**

**For End-to-End Journey Mapping:**
- "Walk me through your entire experience with us from first awareness to today‚Äîwhat were the key moments and how did you feel at each stage?"
- "Which touchpoints in your journey created the most positive experiences versus the most frustration or difficulty?"
- "If you were redesigning your experience with us, what would you change to make it smoother and more satisfying?"

**For Specific Journey Stage Focus:**
- "Tell me about your experience during [onboarding/purchase/support/renewal] - what went well and what created challenges?"
- "What expectations did you have for [specific stage] and how did the actual experience compare?"
- "What information, support, or resources would have improved your experience during this part of your journey?"

**For Cross-Channel Experience:**
- "How do you typically interact with us across different channels (website, app, phone, email), and how consistent is your experience?"
- "Which channels work best for different needs, and where do you experience friction when moving between channels?"
- "How do your different interactions with us connect together, and where do you feel disconnected or have to repeat yourself?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover emotional experience and specific touchpoint details rather than just satisfaction ratings.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Customer Experience Research: Help Us Improve Your Journey With Us"
- **Welcome Message**: "We'd love to understand your experience with us from your perspective to help us create better experiences for customers like you. Your insights about what works well and what could be improved across your entire journey would be incredibly valuable."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Customer Experience Manager, CX Research, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Thank you for sharing your experience! We'll use these insights to improve the customer journey. If you'd like updates on improvements we make based on this feedback, let us know" + update opt-in
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain positive customer relationships
- **Require sign-in**: Recommended for customer journey correlation and follow-up engagement

- **Established customers**: Mid-journey customers with substantial experience
- **Long-term customers**: Those who have been through multiple journey cycles
- **High-value customers**: Your most important customer segments

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
- Send from customer success or account management contacts customers recognize
