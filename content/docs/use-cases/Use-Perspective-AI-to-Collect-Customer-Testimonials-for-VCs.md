# Introduction

VCs want proof. They want to hear from real customers—not just you. But reference calls are a pain to schedule, and written quotes often lack depth. That’s where Perspective AI comes in.

With AI-powered conversations, you can collect rich, authentic feedback from your design partners—fast—and package it into powerful insights for investor diligence.

Here’s exactly how to do it 👇

---

## Create Your Free Perspective AI Account

## Create a New AI Conversation

1. Click **“Create New Conversation.”**
2. Name your conversation something like:  
   **"Design Partner Testimonials for VC Diligence"**
3. When prompted, describe your audience:  
   _“These are early customers helping us validate product-market fit and pricing.”_
4. Clarify your goal:  
   _“I want to collect feedback I can share with VCs—highlighting traction, value, and early customer love.”_
5. (Optional but powerful): Add context about your startup.  
   Drop in a link to your site or paste in a short paragraph so the AI can tailor the conversation to your business.

> ✅ Pro tip: The more context you give, the sharper the interview becomes.

## Review and Customize the Conversation Guide

Perspective AI will auto-generate a personalized conversation guide based on what you’ve shared.

1. Review the questions.
2. Edit or add questions that:
   - Prompt honest, emotional responses
   - Help VCs understand why your startup matters
   - Uncover what would make customers recommend you

**Example edits:**
- “What problem were you solving when you started using [Startup]?”
- “What’s changed since then?”
- “Would you recommend us to others? Why or why not?”

When it looks good—click **“Start Interview.”**

## Invite Your Customers

You’ve got two options:
- Share a **unique link** via email or message
- Use the built-in **“Invite Participants”** feature

Your customers will:
- Talk to your AI interviewer on their own time
- Share thoughtful, in-depth feedback
- Finish in minutes, no scheduling needed

> ⚡ Tip: Give them a quick heads-up via email or Slack:  
> “Hey! You’ll get a short interview from Perspective—it helps us highlight your feedback for investors. It’s super quick.”

## Analyze and Highlight the Best Insights

Once interviews are complete, go to your dashboard:

1. View full transcripts for each conversation
2. Use **Magic Summary** to distill key points
3. Start an **Interactive Analysis Session** and ask:
   - “What themes are emerging across interviews?”
   - “Who gave strong VC-ready testimonials?”
   - “What’s the sentiment around pricing or value?”

🎯 Need to impress investors fast?  
Type: _“Show me quotes that validate our traction.”_

Perspective will organize them into a shareable table in seconds.

You’ve now got:
- Full interviews  
- Summarized insights  
- Shareable quotes and highlight reels

Choose how you want to share:

✅ **Copy and paste highlights** into your pitch deck  
✅ **Export a summary** for your data room  
✅ **Invite VCs directly** to your Perspective space  
✅ **Build a live testimonial board** with curated quotes
