- **Validated partnership opportunities** based on real partner needs and customer demand
- **Optimized channel strategy** informed by partner capabilities and market preferences

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**

- "When you think about ideal vendor relationships, what makes a partnership valuable versus just transactional?"
- "What challenges do you face that could be solved through better collaboration between your technology providers?"
