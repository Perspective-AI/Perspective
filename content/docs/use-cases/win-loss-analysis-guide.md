# How to Use Perspective AI for Win/Loss Analysis & Competitive Positioning

Your sales team wins some deals and loses others, but you're not sure why. Competitive intelligence is fragmented and anecdotal. Lost deals disappear without insights. You're making sales strategy decisions based on internal assumptions rather than buyer feedback.

**Perspective AI transforms win/loss analysis from sporadic debriefs into systematic competitive intelligence** by conducting AI-powered interviews with recent prospects‚Äîboth wins and losses‚Äîrevealing true decision factors, competitive positioning opportunities, and sales process improvements that increase close rates.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of why deals are won or lost based on buyer perspectives
- **Competitive positioning insights** that highlight your advantages and address weaknesses
- **Sales process improvements** informed by real buyer decision-making patterns
- **Actionable strategies** to increase win rates and improve competitive differentiation

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your win/loss analysis research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "Why do we win or lose deals, and how can we improve our competitive positioning?"
   - "What factors most influence prospect decisions in our favor versus competitors?"
   - "How can we better position our solution to increase win rates and deal velocity?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand the key decision factors that determine vendor selection") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Recent prospects across different deal outcomes and characteristics
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent win/loss data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "Walk me through your decision-making process from initial need recognition to final vendor selection."
- "What were the most important factors that influenced your final decision, and how did different vendors perform on these criteria?"
- "If you could go back and change one thing about our sales process or approach, what would it be?"
- "How did you compare the different solutions you evaluated, and what made the difference in your final choice?"
- "What concerns or objections did you have about our solution, and how well were they addressed?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover decision-making processes and competitive comparisons rather than just asking about satisfaction.

---

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Sales Experience Feedback: Help Us Understand Your Decision Process"
- **Welcome Message**: "Thank you for your time during our sales process. We'd love to understand your experience and decision-making process to improve how we serve future prospects. Your honest feedback about our approach and how we compared to alternatives would be incredibly valuable."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Sales Operations, Revenue Operations, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Thank you for your insights. If you have additional feedback or questions, feel free to reach out" + contact information
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain professional relationships
- **Require sign-in**: Optional‚Äîconsider anonymity for more honest feedback vs. follow-up capabilities
- **Access level**: Keep as "Account" (visible to your team only)

---

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants across deal outcomes:**
- **Recent wins**: Customers who chose your solution in the past 3-6 months
- **Recent losses**: Prospects who chose competitors in the past 3-6 months
- **Stalled deals**: Prospects whose deals went inactive or were postponed
- **Different deal sizes**: Mix of enterprise, mid-market, and SMB prospects
- **Various industries**: Representatives from different vertical markets or use cases
- **Decision makers**: Both economic buyers and user/technical evaluators

**Choose your outreach method:**

**Link Sharing** (Most common):
- Copy the unique conversation link
- Send via email or LinkedIn from sales team members
- Position as process improvement research rather than sales follow-up

**Email Integration**:
- Use built-in email invitations
- Send directly from Perspective AI platform

**Sample invitation message for wins:**
> "Hi [Name], Thank you again for choosing us! To help us improve our sales process for future prospects, would you mind sharing your experience and what influenced your decision? This AI-guided conversation takes 10 minutes and helps us better serve companies like yours. [insert link]"

**Sample invitation message for losses:**
> "Hi [Name], Thank you for considering us during your evaluation process. To help us better serve future prospects, would you mind sharing feedback about your decision process and experience? This AI-guided conversation takes 10 minutes and your honest insights would be valuable for improving our approach. [insert link]"

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
- Reach out through the primary sales contact who built rapport
- Time outreach 2-4 weeks after decision (not too fresh, not too stale)
- Emphasize process improvement rather than sales follow-up
- Consider small incentives like industry reports or gift cards

## Step 5: Let Perspective AI Conduct the Interviews

**What happens next:**
- Participants click the link and start conversations on their own time
- Perspective AI conducts natural, conversational interviews
- Each conversation adapts based on participant responses about their decision process and experience
- All win/loss insights are automatically recorded and organized by deal outcome and characteristics

**Typical interview flow:**
1. Decision process overview and timeline exploration
2. Evaluation criteria and vendor comparison discussion
3. Sales experience and interaction quality assessment
4. Competitive positioning and differentiation analysis
5. Decision factors and final selection rationale
6. Thank you and relationship maintenance

**‚è±Ô∏è Timeline:** Most participants complete interviews within 48-72 hours, with candid feedback due to the post-decision timing and process improvement focus.

## FAQs

**Q: How do I get prospects who chose competitors to participate in win/loss interviews?**
A: Position as market research that benefits the industry. Many buyers appreciate contributing to vendor improvement. Avoid sales follow-up language and emphasize process improvement.

**Q: Should sales reps conduct their own win/loss interviews?**
A: Third-party or neutral internal parties typically get more honest feedback. Sales reps can be involved in follow-up but may not get candid competitive feedback during the initial interview.

**Q: How soon after a deal closes should I conduct win/loss interviews?**
A: 2-4 weeks after decision allows enough time for implementation to start but keeps the evaluation process fresh in memory.

**Q: What if win/loss analysis reveals fundamental product or pricing issues?**
A: This is valuable strategic intelligence. Use findings to inform product roadmap, pricing strategy, or go-to-market approach adjustments.
