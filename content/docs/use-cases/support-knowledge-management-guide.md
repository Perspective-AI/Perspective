# How to Use Perspective AI for Support Knowledge Management & Self-Service Optimization

Your knowledge base exists but customers can't find what they need. Self-service success rates are low despite having extensive documentation. Support agents spend time answering questions that should be self-serviceable. You're creating knowledge content based on internal assumptions rather than real user needs and search patterns.

**Perspective AI transforms knowledge management from content-centric to user-driven optimization** by conducting AI-powered interviews with customers who use self-service resources and support agents who rely on knowledge systems‚Äîrevealing content gaps, usability barriers, and optimization opportunities that improve both customer self-service success and agent efficiency.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **User-driven knowledge strategy** based on real customer information needs and search behaviors
- **Optimized self-service experience** that helps customers find and use information effectively
- **Improved agent efficiency** through better knowledge systems and content organization
- **Content prioritization framework** that focuses on high-impact knowledge gaps and usability improvements

- **Target participants**: Customers using self-service and support agents using knowledge systems
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent knowledge management data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your research focus:**

**For Customer Self-Service Experience:**
- "Walk me through how you typically try to find answers or solve problems before contacting support‚Äîwhat works well and what's frustrating?"
- "When you use our help resources, what makes it easy to find what you need versus what causes you to give up and contact support?"
- "What types of information or guidance would help you solve more problems on your own without needing assistance?"

**For Support Agent Knowledge Experience:**
- "How do you typically find information to help customers, and what knowledge gaps or usability issues slow you down?"
- "What improvements to our knowledge systems would help you provide better and faster support to customers?"
- "When customers ask questions that should be self-serviceable, what's usually missing from our existing knowledge resources?"

**For Knowledge Content and Organization:**
- "What information do you wish was easier to find in our help resources, and how would you organize it differently?"
- "How do you prefer to consume help content (videos, step-by-step guides, FAQs, etc.) for different types of problems?"
- "What examples of great self-service experiences have you had with other companies that we could learn from?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover both functional knowledge gaps and usability barriers rather than just content satisfaction ratings.
