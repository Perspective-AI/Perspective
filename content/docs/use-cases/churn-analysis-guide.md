# How to Use Perspective AI for Churn Analysis & Customer Exit Interviews

Customers cancel and you don't know why. Exit surveys get low response rates and surface-level feedback. Your retention strategies are based on assumptions about churn drivers rather than direct customer insights. Valuable feedback from departing customers is lost forever.

**Perspective AI transforms churn analysis from incomplete data into comprehensive customer insights** by conducting AI-powered exit interviews with recently churned customers‚Äîrevealing true cancellation reasons, systemic issues, and retention opportunities based on authentic customer experiences rather than internal assumptions.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of actual churn reasons from recently churned customers
- **Systemic issue identification** that drives multiple customer cancellations
- **Retention strategy improvements** based on real customer feedback and pain points
- **Proactive churn prevention** insights that help save at-risk customers before they leave

---

## Step 1: Define Your Research Question

**Start your churn analysis research:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary research question**, such as:
   - "Why do customers churn, and what can we learn from recently churned customers to improve retention?"
   - "What specific factors led to customer cancellations, and how can we address these issues?"
   - "What insights from churned customers can help us identify and save at-risk accounts?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Exploratory, Discovery, etc.)
- Detailed research description
- Interview goals and objectives
- Target participant profile
- Initial research plan

---

## Step 2: Refine Your Research Plan

**Review the auto-generated research plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive research plan including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives (e.g., "Understand the primary reasons customers decide to cancel their subscriptions") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participants**: Recently churned customers across different segments and churn timeframes
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent churn analysis data collection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more):**
- "What was the primary reason you decided to cancel your subscription with us?"
- "Walk me through the events or experiences that led to your cancellation decision‚Äîwhen did you first start considering leaving?"
- "What could we have done differently to prevent your cancellation and keep you as a customer?"
- "How did you feel about the value you were getting from our product relative to what you were paying?"
- "If you were advising our customer success team on how to better support customers like you, what would you tell them?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Focus on 2-3 mandatory questions that uncover the customer's journey to cancellation and specific improvement opportunities rather than just asking for ratings.

## Step 3: Customize the Participant Experience

**Set up your research settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Customer Feedback: Help Us Understand Your Experience and Improve"
- **Welcome Message**: "We understand you recently canceled your subscription with us. While we're sorry to see you go, we'd love to learn from your experience to improve our service for future customers. Your honest feedback about what led to your decision would be incredibly valuable."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name, title (Customer Success, Customer Experience, etc.), and brief bio

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Thank you for your valuable feedback. If circumstances change and you'd like to explore working together again, please don't hesitate to reach out" + contact information
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to maintain positive relationships for potential future re-engagement
- **Require sign-in**: Optional‚Äîconsider anonymity for more honest feedback vs. follow-up capabilities
- **Access level**: Keep as "Account" (visible to your team only)

---

## Step 4: Invite Your Target Participants

**Identify ideal participants for churn analysis:**
- **Recently churned customers**: Those who canceled within the past 30-90 days
- **Different churn segments**: Voluntary vs. involuntary cancellations
- **Various customer types**: Different plans, company sizes, industries, or use cases
- **Tenure variations**: Short-term customers (< 6 months) vs. long-term customers (> 1 year)
- **Value segments**: High-value vs. low-value accounts to understand churn patterns
- **Geographic diversity**: Different regions or markets if applicable

**Choose your outreach method:**

**Link Sharing** (Most common):
- Copy the unique conversation link
- Send via email from customer success or account management
- Position as learning opportunity to improve customer experience

**Email Integration**:
- Use built-in email invitations
- Send directly from Perspective AI platform

**Sample invitation message:**
> "Hi [Name], We're sorry to see you go and hope you found value during your time with us. To help us improve our service for future customers, would you mind sharing feedback about your experience and what led to your decision to cancel? This AI-guided conversation takes 10 minutes and your insights would be invaluable for helping us serve customers better. [insert link]"

**üéØ Response rate tips:**
- Send from a trusted customer success contact, not generic email
- Time outreach 1-2 weeks after cancellation (not too immediate, not too distant)
- Emphasize learning and improvement rather than win-back attempts
- Consider small tokens of appreciation like gift cards for participation

---

## Step 5: Let Perspective AI Conduct the Interviews

**What happens next:**
- Recently churned customers click the link and start conversations on their own time
- Perspective AI conducts natural, conversational interviews
- Each conversation adapts based on participant responses about their cancellation experience and reasons
- All churn insights are automatically recorded and organized by churn factors and customer characteristics

**Typical interview flow:**
1. Cancellation reason identification and context exploration
2. Customer journey and experience timeline mapping
3. Value perception and expectation gap assessment
4. Alternative solution evaluation and decision factors
5. Improvement suggestions and retention opportunity identification
6. Thank you and relationship maintenance

**‚è±Ô∏è Timeline:** Most churned customers complete interviews within 48-72 hours, with honest feedback due to the post-relationship timing and improvement focus.
