# How to Use Perspective AI for Accessibility & Inclusive Design Research

Your product isn't accessible to users with disabilities. Accessibility compliance feels like checkbox exercise rather than user-centered design. You're making assumptions about accessibility needs without consulting actual users. Design decisions inadvertently exclude people with diverse abilities and contexts.

**Perspective AI transforms accessibility from compliance requirements into user-driven inclusive design** by conducting AI-powered interviews with users with disabilities, accessibility advocates, and diverse user groups‚Äîrevealing real accessibility barriers, inclusive design opportunities, and user experience improvements that make products genuinely usable by everyone.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Real user insights** about accessibility barriers and inclusive design needs
- **User-centered accessibility improvements** based on actual user experiences rather than compliance checklists
- **Inclusive design strategies** that benefit all users while addressing specific accessibility requirements
- **Systematic approach** to accessibility research that informs ongoing design and development decisions
