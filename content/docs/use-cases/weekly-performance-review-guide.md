# How to Use Perspective AI for Weekly/Monthly Performance & Goal Review

Your weeks and months pass by without meaningful reflection. You complete tasks but don't assess whether you're making progress on what matters most. Performance reviews catch you off guard because you haven't been tracking your accomplishments. You have goals but no systematic way to evaluate progress and adjust course.

**Perspective AI transforms personal reflection from sporadic journaling into systematic performance analysis** by helping you create structured self-interview guides that organize your thoughts, track meaningful progress, and generate actionable insights for continuous improvement and goal achievement.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- **Structured reflection process** that helps you systematically review performance and progress
- **Clear accomplishment tracking** that captures your wins and builds confidence over time  
- **Goal progress assessment** that keeps you aligned with what matters most
- **Actionable insights** for continuous improvement and strategic decision-making

## Step 1: Define Your Self-Reflection Framework

**Start your personal performance review setup:**
1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary reflection question**, such as:
   - "How can I systematically reflect on my performance, progress, and goals to improve my effectiveness and decision-making?"
   - "What were my key accomplishments, challenges, and learnings this week/month?"
   - "How am I progressing toward my goals and what adjustments should I make?"

**Perspective AI will automatically generate a research plan which includes:**
- Research type (Self-Assessment, Performance Review, etc.)
- Detailed reflection framework
- Self-interview goals and objectives
- Personal assessment structure
- Initial reflection plan

## Step 2: Design Your Self-Interview Questions

**Review the auto-generated reflection plan:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive self-reflection framework including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives for your reflection process (e.g., "Track goal progress and identify improvement opportunities") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participant**: You, conducting regular self-assessment
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure consistent and meaningful self-reflection

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your reflection focus:**

**For Weekly Performance Review:**
- "What were my three biggest accomplishments this week, and what made them successful?"
- "What challenges did I encounter, and how did I handle them? What would I do differently?"
- "How did I spend my time this week, and how well did it align with my priorities?"

**For Monthly Goal Assessment:**
- "What progress did I make toward my key goals this month, and what factors contributed to or hindered that progress?"
- "What new skills, knowledge, or insights did I gain, and how can I apply them going forward?"
- "What patterns do I notice in my performance and decision-making over the past month?"

**For Strategic Reflection:**
- "What activities gave me the most energy and satisfaction, and what drained my energy?"
- "What opportunities am I seeing that I should pursue, and what should I stop doing?"
- "How am I growing personally and professionally, and where do I want to focus next?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that balance accomplishment recognition with forward-looking improvement insights.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Personal Reflection Experience

**Configure your self-interview settings:**

**Greeting & Context:**
- **Conversation Title**: "Weekly Performance Review" or "Monthly Goal Assessment" (customize based on your cadence)
- **Welcome Message**: "Time to reflect on your recent performance and progress. This structured conversation will help you organize your thoughts, recognize accomplishments, and identify opportunities for improvement."
- **Researcher Info**: Add your name and any personal context that helps frame the reflection

**Participant Experience:**
- **End-of-interview CTA**: "Great reflection! Review your insights and consider what actions you'll take based on this assessment" + link to action planning template
- **Auto-send thank you email**: Enable to receive a summary of your reflection
- **Require sign-in**: Recommended to track your reflection history over time
- **Access level**: Keep as "Private" (visible only to you)

---

## Step 4: Schedule Your Reflection Routine

**Establish your personal reflection cadence:**

**Weekly Reviews (recommended frequency):**
- **Timing**: Friday afternoon or Sunday evening
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes for thorough weekly reflection
- **Focus**: Recent accomplishments, immediate challenges, upcoming priorities

**Monthly Assessments:**
- **Timing**: Last day of the month or first day of new month
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes for comprehensive monthly review
- **Focus**: Goal progress, pattern recognition, strategic adjustments

**Choose your approach:**

**Calendar Integration:**
- Schedule recurring reflection sessions as non-negotiable appointments
- Set reminders 15 minutes before to prepare mentally
- Block time when you're typically most reflective and honest

**Sample reflection schedule:**
> "Every Friday at 4 PM: Complete weekly performance review using Perspective AI conversation. Review insights over the weekend and plan next week's priorities based on learnings."

**üéØ Consistency tips:**
- Start with weekly reviews to build the habit before adding monthly assessments
- Choose the same day and time each week to create routine
- Prepare by reviewing your calendar, task list, and goal progress before starting
- Keep your reflection conversation link easily accessible (bookmark, save to phone, etc.)
