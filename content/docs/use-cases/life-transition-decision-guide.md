# How to Use Perspective AI for Life Transition & Decision-Making Support

You're facing a major life decision but feel overwhelmed by the options and implications. Important choices feel confusing because you're not sure what you really want or value most. Life transitions create anxiety because you lack a clear process for working through complex decisions. You make choices reactively rather than strategically based on your deeper priorities.

**Perspective AI transforms life decision-making from emotional overwhelm into structured clarity** by helping you create guided self-reflection processes that clarify your values, assess options systematically, understand your motivations, and make confident decisions during significant life transitions based on self-awareness and strategic thinking.

- **Clear values and priorities** that guide major life decisions and transitions
- **Systematic decision-making process** that reduces overwhelm and increases confidence
- **Comprehensive option assessment** that considers both practical and emotional factors

## Step 1: Define Your Life Decision Framework

1. Go to [getperspective.ai/signup](https://getperspective.ai/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=use-case-guides) and create your account
2. Click "Create New Conversation"
3. **Define your primary life decision question**, such as:
   - "How can I work through complex life decisions and transitions by systematically reflecting on my values, priorities, and options?"
   - "What decision-making process will help me navigate this major life transition with confidence and clarity?"
   - "How can I clarify what I really want and make choices that align with my deepest values and long-term goals?"

## Step 2: Design Your Life Decision Self-Interview

**Review the auto-generated life decision framework:**

Perspective AI creates a comprehensive life transition reflection including:
- **Goals**: 3 specific objectives for your decision-making process (e.g., "Clarify personal values and assess life transition options") - you can define additional goals in the refinement step
- **Target participant**: You, working through significant life decisions and transitions
- **Core questions**: Foundation questions that ensure meaningful life reflection and decision clarity

**Customize by adding mandatory questions (we recommend up to 3, but you can define more) based on your transition focus:**

**For Values and Priorities Clarification:**
- "What values and priorities are most important to me right now, and how do my current life choices align with them?"
- "When I imagine my ideal life in 5-10 years, what does it look like, and what would need to change to get there?"
- "What aspects of my current life give me the most satisfaction and energy versus what drains or frustrates me?"

**For Decision Options Assessment:**
- "What are all the realistic options I'm considering for this life decision, including the option of staying with the status quo?"
- "What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option, both in the short term and long term?"
- "What fears, concerns, or limiting beliefs might be influencing how I evaluate these options?"

**For Implementation and Commitment:**
- "What would I need to see or experience to feel confident that I'm making the right choice?"
- "What support, resources, or changes would I need to successfully implement my decision?"
- "How will I know if my decision is working out well, and what would I do if I need to course-correct?"

**üí° Pro tip:** Choose 2-3 mandatory questions that balance values exploration with practical option assessment and implementation planning.

## FAQs

**Q: How long should I spend making a major life decision?**

A: This is normal for complex life decisions. Focus on which option aligns best with your values and offers the best growth potential, rather than seeking a perfect choice.

**Q: Should I involve others in my life decision-making process?**
